          <p>Nintendo offers a wide variety of tools to help parents restrict content on Nintendo systems. Give your kids the freedom to play and explore in an environment you manage with Parental Controls. With Parental Controls, you can easily set guidelines for your family’s system – including setting restrictions on which players can communicate with your child online - so you can all relax and have fun. Take control of what your child can (and can't) do on their system. Be sure to talk to your kids about what kind of information they shouldn't be sharing online, like their name, address, email address, and phone number.</p>
          <p>Make informed choices for your family with the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) system of ratings. Not sure which games are appropriate for kids of a certain age? Rating Categories let you know at a glance if a game is right for your child.</p>
